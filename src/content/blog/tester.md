Let’s be honest — no one likes testing their own app. It is boring, time-consuming, and costly.

For years, developers and product managers have been stuck between two bad options: spending hours manually clicking through every feature or maintaining fragile automation scripts that break the moment you change a single button's color.

But what if you could hire a QA tester who never sleeps, requires no manual configuration, and understands your app's logic just by looking at it?

Meet **omoka** — the visual AI agent for QA testing.

## The Problem: Why manual testing kills momentum

You only get one chance to make a first impression. When users encounter a bug, they stop trusting you, and your brand’s credibility disappears.

However, maintaining high velocity while ensuring a bug-free experience is nearly impossible for small teams. Traditional automation tools are often "blind" scripts that require complicated setup and constant maintenance. The moment your UI changes, those scripts fail, leaving you back at square one.

## What is omoka?

**omoka** is a visual AI agent that tests your app exactly like a human would. It doesn't just follow a rigid script; it sees and understands the screen to make decisions in real time.

By delegating your QA to omoka, you get a safety net that hunts down complex edge cases that humans usually hate testing.

## How it works: See, Understand, Test

### 1. Context Learning

omoka onboards itself to skip manual configuration. It learns your app’s unique business logic instantly, avoiding the mindless clicks of standard automation.

### 2. Natural Delegation

You don't need to write code. You can review test scenarios omoka proposes automatically or simply chat with the AI. Just ask it to "check the login flow," and omoka turns your words into actions.

### 3. Visual Intelligence

Because omoka uses visual understanding instead of rigid code selectors, it adapts to layout changes automatically. You can redesign your UI without having to rewrite a single test.

## Smart reporting: Tickets that actually help

When omoka finds a bug, it doesn't just tell you "something is wrong." It provides clear proof of every error.

Bugs land automatically in your backlog — whether you use Jira or any other tool. Each ticket contains:

- Full video recordings.
- Detailed logs.
- Clear reproduction steps.

## Who is omoka for?

## FAQ

**1. When can I get access?** We are currently finalizing omoka for our first group of early adopters. By requesting access, you secure a priority spot on the waitlist for our beta launch.

**2. How does omoka differ from other QA tools?** Other tools are blind scripts. omoka uses visual intelligence to see, think, and propose scenarios automatically, cutting out manual work entirely.

**3. What kind of apps can it test?** If it runs in a browser (SaaS, e-commerce, dashboards), omoka can test it.
