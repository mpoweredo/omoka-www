# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** December 21, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) carefully before using the **omoka** web application and autonomous testing agent (the “Service”) operated by **omoka** (“us”, “we”, or “our”).

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.

## 1. Accounts & Eligibility

* **Age Requirement:** You must be at least **16 years old** to use this Service. If you are under 18, you confirm that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to use the Service.
* **Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding the credentials used to access the Service. You agree not to disclose your login access to any third party. You are responsible for all actions performed by the Service within your target applications based on your instructions.
* **One Account Per User:** You may not create multiple accounts to bypass usage limits, free trial restrictions, or parallel execution caps. Violation of this rule will result in an immediate ban.

## 2. AI Services & Automated Interactions

**omoka** utilizes artificial intelligence technologies and headless browser automation to analyze websites, generate test scenarios, and execute actions (clicking, typing, scrolling) on live applications.

* **Live Execution Warning:** Unlike passive tools, **omoka interacts with your application actively.** It performs actions such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, and modifying data based on generated scenarios. **You are solely responsible** for ensuring that these actions are performed in a safe environment (e.g., Staging/QA) and not on critical Production data without safeguards.
* **Accuracy Disclaimer:** AI-generated scenarios and visual analysis are probabilistic. While omoka strives to mimic human perception, it may occasionally produce false positives (reporting a bug where there is none) or false negatives (missing a visual error). The Service acts as a support tool to augment, not replace, final human decision-making.
* **No Liability for Data Loss:** We are not liable for any data loss, unintended transactions, or state changes in your target application caused by the test scenarios executed by omoka.
* **Content Policy:** You may not use the AI features to generate or test illegal, harmful, sexually explicit, or malicious content.

## 3. Acceptable Use & Authorized Targets

To ensure the safety and legality of the Service, you agree to the following strict usage policies:

* **Authorized Targets Only:** You represent and warrant that you own the target URL(s) provided to omoka for testing, or that you have express written permission from the owner to perform automated scanning and interaction tests on those URLs. Using omoka to test, scrape, or "stress test" third-party websites without authorization is strictly prohibited.
* **Abuse & Stability:** You agree NOT to use the Service to execute Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or generate excessive load that degrades the performance of the target application beyond reasonable testing limits.
* **Exploit Trials:** Create multiple accounts to repeatedly benefit from free tiers or trial periods.
* **Reverse Engineer:** Attempt to decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any part of the Service or its underlying AI agents.
* **Fair Use:** We reserve the right to throttle or suspend access for users whose usage patterns (e.g., extremely long test scenarios, excessive parallel executions) significantly exceed the average usage of typical customers, negatively impacting the Service’s infrastructure.

## 4. Intellectual Property

* **Our IP:** The Service, its original content, AI models, "Virtual Employee" logic, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of omoka.
* **Your IP:** You retain all rights to the test scenarios you create (or approve), the specific reports generated for your projects, and the data contained within your target applications. We claim no ownership over your application's code or business logic.

## 5. Subscriptions & Payments

* **Billing:** Paid services are billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (e.g., monthly). Payments are processed securely via **Stripe**. We do not store your card details.
* **Cancellation:** You may cancel your subscription at any time via your account settings. Access will continue until the end of the current billing period.
* **Refunds:** Payments are non-refundable, except as required by applicable EU consumer law. We do not offer refunds for partially used billing periods.
* **Price Changes:** We may modify subscription fees. Any price change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice.

## 6. Third-Party Links and Integrations

Our Service may contain links to or integrations with third-party web sites or services (e.g., Jira, ClickUp, Slack) that are not owned or controlled by omoka.

* **Data Sharing:** By enabling these integrations, you grant us permission to send bug reports and test data to these platforms on your behalf.
* **Responsibility:** We assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 7. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms (e.g., testing unauthorized URLs, trial abuse, or payment failure).

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall **omoka** be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this service.

**Specifically, omoka is not liable for any downtime, data corruption, or service interruption of the User's target application resulting from the automated tests performed by the Service.**

## 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of **Poland**, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved in the competent courts of Poland.

## 10. Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
