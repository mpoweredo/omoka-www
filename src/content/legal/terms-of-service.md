# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** November 21, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the devtimate web application (the "Service") operated by devtimate ("us", "we", or "our").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.

## 1. Accounts & Eligibility

- **Age Requirement:** You must be at least **16 years old** to use this Service. If you are under 18, you confirm that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to use the Service.
- **Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding the authentication code or credentials used to access the Service. You agree not to disclose your login access to any third party.
- **One Account Per User:** You may not create multiple accounts to simulate or act as a single user, or to bypass usage limits and free trial restrictions. Violation of this rule will result in an immediate ban.

## 2. AI Services & Disclaimer

devtimate utilizes artificial intelligence technologies (including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic) to generate project estimates and breakdowns.

- **Accuracy Warning:** AI-generated estimates are probabilistic predictions, not guarantees. They serve as a **support tool** for professionals. **You are solely responsible** for reviewing, verifying, and adjusting all outputs before using them in commercial proposals.
- **No Liability:** We are not liable for any business losses, underestimations, or contract disputes arising from the use of our AI-generated content.
- **Content Policy:** You may not use the AI features to generate illegal, harmful, sexually explicit, or malicious content.

## 3. Acceptable Use & Fair Use Policy

To ensure the stability and availability of the Service for all users, you agree NOT to:

- **Abuse API/AI:** Send automated, excessive, or unreasonable requests to our servers (e.g., using scripts or bots to scrape data or abuse AI token generation).
- **Exploit Trials:** Create multiple accounts to repeatedly benefit from free tiers or trial periods.
- **Reverse Engineer:** Attempt to decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any part of the Service.
- **Share Accounts:** Share a single paid subscription seat among multiple individuals (unless part of a specific Team Plan).

**Fair Use:** We reserve the right to throttle or suspend access for users whose usage patterns significantly exceed the average usage of typical customers (e.g., generating thousands of estimates per day), negatively impacting the Service's performance or costs.

## 4. Intellectual Property

- **Our IP:** The Service, its original content (excluding your inputs), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of devtimate.
- **Your IP:** You retain all rights to the documents you upload and the specific project estimates generated for you. We claim no ownership over your project data.

## 5. Subscriptions & Payments

- **Billing:** Paid services are billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (e.g., monthly). Payments are processed securely via **Stripe**. We do not store your card details.
- **Cancellation:** You may cancel your subscription at any time via your account settings. Access will continue until the end of the current billing period.
- **Refunds:** Payments are non-refundable, except as required by applicable EU consumer law. We do not offer refunds for partially used billing periods.
- **Price Changes:** We may modify subscription fees. Any price change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice.

## 6. Third-Party Links and Services

Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services (e.g., Jira, Asana, Hetzner) that are not owned or controlled by devtimate. We assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 7. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms (e.g., trial abuse, payment failure, or violation of acceptable use).

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall devtimate be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this service.

## 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of **Poland**, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved in the competent courts of Poland.

## 10. Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
