This Privacy Policy explains how devtimate ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you use our web application and associated services.

## Data We Collect

We collect only the data necessary to provide our estimation services:

- **Account Information:** Email address and authentication details (via secure code login).
- **Uploaded Documents:** Project files such as specifications, SRS, RFPs, and other context files uploaded for estimate generation.
- **User-generated Content:** Estimate inputs, prompts, task descriptions, and related project content.
- **Usage Data & Analytics:** IP address, device information, browser type, and behavioral metrics (via session recordings and heatmaps).

## Purpose of Data Use

We process your data solely for the following purposes:

- **AI Estimation:** To generate project estimates and technical breakdowns using AI providers (OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, Anthropic API).
- **Context Management:** To store worksheet-related files securely to provide necessary context to the AI Agent during your session.

- **Service Improvement:** To analyze aggregated usage data and user behavior to improve application performance and user experience.

## Third-party Subprocessors

We partner with trusted third-party services to provide our infrastructure and AI capabilities. We ensure that these partners adhere to strict data privacy standards.

#### AI Service Providers

_Important: We utilize the Enterprise/API versions of these services. Your data is **NOT** used to train their foundation models._

- **OpenAI:** Used for generating estimates. See: [OpenAI Enterprise Privacy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy).

- **Anthropic:** Used for complex reasoning. Data sent via API is not used for model training. See: [Anthropic Commercial Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms).

#### Infrastructure & Analytics

- **Hetzner Online GmbH:** All worksheet uploads, database entries, and persistent data are stored on servers located in the **European Union (Germany/Finland)**. Hetzner complies with ISO/IEC 27001 and uses strict access controls. See: [Hetzner Certifications](https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/zertifizierung/).

## Data Retention

We retain your personal data and project files only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

- **Project Context:** Files used for AI estimation are retained within the project scope to enable the AI Agent to maintain context.
- **Deletion:** Users can permanently delete specific projects or their entire account at any time. Upon account deletion, all associated data is erased from our active databases immediately.
- **No Training:** We reiterate that your uploaded documents and generated content are **never** used to train our own or third-party AI models.

## Security

The security of your data is our top priority. We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures, including:

- **Encryption:** All data is encrypted **in transit** (via TLS 1.2/1.3) and **at rest** (AES-256 encryption standards).
- **Access Control:** Strict role-based access control to internal systems.
- **Secure Infrastructure:** Hosting within ISO-certified data centers (Hetzner) in the EU.

## International Data Transfers

Our primary storage is located in the European Union. However, AI processing may require transmitting prompts to servers in the United States (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). These transfers are protected by standard data protection addendums and enterprise agreements ensuring your data remains confidential and is not used for model training.
